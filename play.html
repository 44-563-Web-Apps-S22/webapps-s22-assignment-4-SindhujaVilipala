        <h3> SCENE II.â€”ARGAN, TOINETTE.</h3>
        ARG. (_thinking himself alone_). Mr. Purgon told me that I was to

TOI. Sir, here is a gentleman....

ARG. Speak in a lower tone, you jade; you split my head open; and you
forget that we should never speak so loud to sick people.

TOI. I wanted to tell you, Sir....

ARG. Speak low, I tell you.

TOI. Sir.... (_She moves her lips as if she were speaking._)

ARG. What?

TOI. I tell you that.... (_As before._)
